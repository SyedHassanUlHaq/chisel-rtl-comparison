# Chisel RTL Comparison

This repository, **chisel-rtl-comparison**, hosts the code and results from a comparative analysis of RTL code generated by Chisel3 and Chisel6, as explored in the research paper _"Comparative Analysis of Chisel3 vs. Chisel6 Generated RTL."_

## Overview

The research focuses on the evolution of the Chisel hardware description language and its ability to generate efficient, readable, and maintainable RTL (Register Transfer Level) code. This study evaluates Chisel3 and Chisel6 based on key factors, including:

- **Readability of Generated RTL Code**
- **Compilation Time**
- **Community Support and Documentation**

The findings highlight the advancements in Chisel6, particularly due to its adoption of the CIRCT framework, which significantly enhances readability, debugging traceability, and overall user experience.

## Key Conclusions

- **Improved Readability**  
  Chisel6 generates more human-readable RTL code compared to Chisel3, benefiting from a modular structure, inline source mapping, and reduced boilerplate.

- **Enhanced Compilation Efficiency**  
  Compilation times were notably faster with Chisel6, attributed to the optimizations introduced by CIRCT.

- **Better Community Support**  
  Chisel6 offers superior documentation and a growing community, making it more accessible and developer-friendly for modern hardware design.

- **Debugging and Traceability**  
  Chisel6's output includes source-level references, providing engineers with direct mappings to high-level Chisel code, significantly improving debugging efficiency.
